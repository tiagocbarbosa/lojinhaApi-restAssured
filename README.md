# lojinhaApi-restAssured
My application tests the [RESTful APIs](https://www.postman.com/restless-trinity-831044/workspace/lojinha-api/overview) created by [JÃºlio de Lima](http://www.juliodelima.com.br/) using REST Assured.

I'm using the framework to learn it, and a challenge I faced was a interesting way to pass the body request with REST Assured without writing the JSON in the code. [Jackson Databind](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-databind/2.13.1) helped me with that.

In the future I hope to add more testing scenarios to the application.

## Prerequisites
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Maven 3+
- JDK 17+

## Installation
1. Clone the repository in your machine.
2. Open it in IntelliJ.
3. Install JDK through IntelliJ in case you don't have it.

## Usage
For instance, open the [ProdutoTest](https://github.com/tiagocbarbosa/lojinhaApi-restAssured/blob/main/src/test/java/modules/produto/ProdutoTest.java) file in IntelliJ and run the tests. The IDEA's console output should look like this:

```
Process finished with exit code 0
```
